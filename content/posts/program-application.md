This post belongs to a serious story about How I moved my family from China to Sweden as a Software Engineer.

## Motivation

We are a Chinese couple with one child, my wife and I had a hard time during the massive lockdown invoked by the authority in the name of Covid-19; we saw too many tragedies happen; we saw older adults die on their beds; we saw pregnant women being dragged to the Fangcang for isolation in Shanghai; we saw a severe traffic accident occurred in Qiannan Prefecture, Guizhou Province, a bus carrying 47 people overturned, killing 27 people; we saw fire in Urumqi apartment buildings in Xinjiang killed ten people; There are too many tragedies happened, and these are all artificial disasters.

We want a peaceful life; if this country can not guarantee this, we'll find another one. It's a tough decision to make; we have to leave our parents here for a long time and give up our friendships here.

## Decision

We have two choices, first is to find a job, and the second is to study abroad, both ways we need to adapt to the local life. I initially wanted to go to Canada because many people go there and have a good life there, but finding a job outside Canada kind of a business cost a fortune, and that left us to study abroad.

We then consulted a lot about studying things, and one day my wife told me that she wanted to live in Europe; that brought us a whole new world of relocation; it's just way more affordable than going to Canada; I happened to know someone in Sweden on Twitter whom is working as a DA and is a former student that studied in a High Vocational School, I then consulted her, found out that this is a perfect way for us. We are going to Sweden.

## Choosing a Program

I have to find a program that suits me most as I'm a Full Stack Engineer. After many searches, I found this [Frontend Developer](https://www.hyperisland.com/programs-and-courses/frontend-developer) program offered by Hyper Island.

This is a perfect program for me; I know most of its courses, and the main reason me choosing this program is the way they adapted to teaching Learning By Doing so. I'll have the chance to taste labor marketing in Sweden; that's all I want to learn.

## Application Flow

I initially walked through the application flow and gained a basic understanding of the actual progress, and I found that they had a Q&A meeting. Then I signed in to hear things they were talking about.

And I also book an individual consult meeting with the associations of this program.

After these two meetings, I have a basic understanding of what this program is mainly about and the courses of this program, and how Hyper Island teaches people.

I then prepare my gradients for this program application and submit them; I then attend my Digital Admissions Day, composed of an individual interview and a group task, which is a lot of fun. It took me a week of waiting for the decision. During this waiting, I had another meeting with the program manager, which took me through the details of the courses; it was happy for them to introduce me to so many elements. After all those processes, I got accepted into this program.

I then signed the Education Agreement to confirm that seat. A few days later, I received my first invoice; I paid to lock my heart.

## Learn the basic Swedish and culture

All I need to do next is to prepare to apply for my Residence Permits for Studies and the Residence Permits for my family, relax and learn some basic Swedish and their culture.
